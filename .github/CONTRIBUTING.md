# Contribution Guidelines

* Always mark the script as executable (`chmod +x`). Also, we don't like file extensions (`.sh`, `.py`, etc).
* If your script only works in a particular operating system, be sure to mention that in the README and in the script (as comment).
* Add platform-specific scripts to the end of the list.
* Don't add a description in README unless it is extremely needed.
